<H1>A house for some c stuff</H1>

<H6>hrAvgAccessTime.c - calculates the hit ratio for memory references (only two levels)</H6>
<H6>tempConvert.c - fahrenheit to celsius/celsius to fahrenheit - works either with command line args or if not entered defaults to user input</H6>
<H6>threadSem.c - a program I was using to experiement with the processor interleaving and semaphores to straighten out the race conditions.</H6>
